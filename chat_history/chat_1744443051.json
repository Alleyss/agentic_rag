            "image_description": "The image is a diagram of a Transformer architecture, commonly used in natural language processing. Here's a breakdown of the components and their relationships:\n\n**Overall Structure:**\n\n*   The diagram shows the encoder-decoder structure of a Transformer. The left side represents the encoder, and the right side represents the decoder.\n*   Both the encoder and decoder consist of repeated layers. The symbol \"Nx\" on both sides indicates that the blocks within the gray rounded rectangles are repeated \"N\" times.\n\n**Encoder (Left Side):**\n\n1.  **Inputs:** Data (e.g., words, tokens) enter the encoder from the bottom.\n2.  **Input Embedding:** The input data is converted into vector representations (embeddings).\n3.  **Positional Encoding:** Positional information is added to the embeddings. This is necessary because Transformers, unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), don't inherently process the input sequence in order.\n4.  **Multi-Head Attention:** The encoded embeddings are fed into a \"Multi-Head Attention\" block, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing it.\n5.  **Add & Norm:** A \"Add & Norm\" block follows the \"Multi-Head Attention.\" This block likely involves adding the original input (the embedding) to the output of the attention mechanism (a residual connection) and then applying layer normalization.\n6.  **Feed Forward:** The output of the \"Add & Norm\" block is then passed through a feed-forward network, typically consisting of one or more fully connected layers.\n7.  **Add & Norm:** Again, another \"Add & Norm\" block is applied to the output of the feed-forward network, similar to the previous instance.\n8.  **Repeat (Nx):** The \"Multi-Head Attention,\" \"Add & Norm,\" \"Feed Forward,\" and another \"Add & Norm\" blocks are repeated N times to create a deep encoder.\n\n**Decoder (Right Side):**\n\n1.  **Outputs (Shifted Right):** The decoder receives the output sequence from the encoder as input. The text \"Outputs (shifted right)\" suggests that the output sequence is shifted by one position, likely for the purpose of autoregressive prediction (predicting the next element in the sequence based on the preceding elements).\n2.  **Output Embedding:** Similar to the input, the output sequence is converted into embeddings.\n3.  **Positional Encoding:** Positional information is added to the embeddings.\n4.  **Masked Multi-Head Attention:** A \"Masked Multi-Head Attention\" block is used. The masking is crucial to prevent the decoder from \"cheating\" by looking at future tokens in the sequence during training. It only attends to the tokens that have already been generated.\n5.  **Add & Norm:** An \"Add & Norm\" block is applied.\n6.  **Multi-Head Attention:** This is another \"Multi-Head Attention\" block that takes the output of the encoder, as well as the previous block.\n7.  **Add & Norm:** An \"Add & Norm\" block is applied.\n8.  **Feed Forward:** A feed-forward network processes the output.\n9.  **Add & Norm:** Another \"Add & Norm\" block is applied.\n10. **Repeat (Nx):** The \"Masked Multi-Head Attention,\" \"Add & Norm,\" \"Multi-Head Attention\", \"Add & Norm\", \"Feed Forward\" and \"Add & Norm\" blocks are repeated N times, similar to the encoder.\n\n**Output Layer:**\n\n1.  **Linear:** A linear layer transforms the decoder's output into a suitable format for the final prediction.\n2.  **Softmax:** A softmax function is applied to the output of the linear layer to produce a probability distribution over the possible output tokens.\n3.  **Output Probabilities:** The softmax output represents the probabilities of different tokens being the next element in the sequence.\n\n**Connections and Data Flow:**\n\n*   Arrows indicate the flow of data through the different blocks.\n*   Curved arrows, particularly in the \"Add & Norm\" blocks, indicate residual connections.\n*   The encoder and decoder communicate via the output of the encoder, which is used as an input in a multi-head attention layer of the decoder.\n\nIn summary, the diagram depicts a Transformer model, showing the encoder-decoder structure, the core building blocks (attention mechanisms, feed-forward networks, normalization layers), and the overall flow of data.\n",
