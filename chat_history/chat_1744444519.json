This indicates that positional information is added to the input embeddings. The \"+\" symbol below the sine wave and above the Input Embedding box indicates that positional encoding is added to the input embedding.\n\n4.  **Encoder Stack (Left Side):**\n    *   There is a stack of two identical blocks. The \"Nx\" symbol suggests that these blocks are repeated N times.\n    *   Each block contains the following:\n        *   \"Multi-Head Attention\": An orange rectangle where the outputs of the previous layers are processed.\n        *   \"Add & Norm\": A yellow rectangle following the attention mechanism, implying addition and normalization operations.\n        *   \"Feed Forward\": A blue rectangle following the add and norm operations representing a feed-forward neural network.\n        *   \"Add & Norm\": A yellow rectangle following the feed-forward neural network, implying addition and normalization operations.\n        *   There are bypass connections around the Multi-Head Attention and Feed Forward layers that are added with the input of each layer.\n\n5.  **Decoder Stack (Right Side):**\n\n    *   Similar to the encoder, there is a stack of identical blocks labeled \"Nx\" indicating repetition.\n    *   Each block contains:\n        *   \"Masked Multi-Head Attention\": A masked version of the multi-head attention mechanism\n        *   \"Add & Norm\": A yellow rectangle following the attention mechanism, implying addition and normalization operations.\n        *   \"Multi-Head Attention\": Multi-head attention mechanism.\n        *   \"Add & Norm\": A yellow rectangle following the attention mechanism, implying addition and normalization operations.\n        *   \"Feed Forward\": A blue rectangle following the add and norm operations representing a feed-forward neural network.\n        *   \"Add & Norm\": A yellow rectangle following the feed-forward neural network, implying addition and normalization operations.\n        *   There are bypass connections around the masked Multi-Head Attention, Multi-Head Attention, and Feed Forward layers that are added with the input of each layer.\n\n6.  **Output Embedding and Positional Encoding:** The bottom right has \"Outputs (shifted right)\". Above this, there is a rectangle labeled \"Output Embedding\". To the left of it is \"Positional Encoding\", a sinusoid next to a \"+\" sign. This indicates the positional information is added to the output embeddings.\n\n7.  **Linear and Softmax Layers:**\n    *   \"Linear\": Above the decoder stack, there's a purple rectangle labeled \"Linear\", which likely refers to a linear transformation applied to the output.\n    *   \"Softmax\": Finally, there's a green rectangle labeled \"Softmax\", which is a function used to generate output probabilities.
